            In this section I'll be talking a little more about myself, and possibly be modified in the future depending on how suitable I find it to be when showing it to possible job or internship companies. Besides studying and programming, some of my hobbies are watching movies and going to restaurants with my  friends, watching series on TV, and playing videogames.<br />

            My favorite movies and series are the Star Wars movies, the recent Marvel Comics movies and series. On the gaming side, I prefer to play on my consoles. Some of my favorite games are Halo, Gears of War, The Last of Us, Uncharted.<br />
            
            <br />
            
            As one may have noticed, I do love a good story and a good storytelling. I get this with movies and serieses but the storytelling in videogames is something very different thanks to how interactive they are. Playing these videogames and seeing the companies behind them is what inspired me to study Computer Science. One of my goals after I finish my studies and start in the working world is to work in a videogame. This documentary shows the story of one of my favorite developers and one of the best videogame companies right now.<br /><br />

            Here are trailers for Halo, Gears of War, The Last of Us, and Uncharted. These games are just a small part of all the vieogames I've played in my life, but what sets them apart is their brilliant storytelling and how they can engage the user.
